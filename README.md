# Dollar Pizza - React

![alt-text-includes-image-credit](dollar-pizza-website.png)

## The Goal
Everyone knows that dollar pizza is the best deal in the city (maybe the world). In this lab we are going to finish building a website for Jeff's Dollar Pizza shop using React.

Jeff hired a web developer to start the website. Sadly, the developer got tired of New York City winters, moved to Thailand, and works as a full-time yoga instructor at a boutique all inclusive hotel. Jeff can't get in contact with the developer and all he has left is the incomplete code for the website.

Our job is to complete the website for Jeff's Dollar Pizza so it looks like the mock-up above.

## The Setup
Clone this repository. In the terminal, run the following commands:

```HTML
npm install
npm start
```

Once everything is installed and you have started up the website, take a look and see what the website looks like now.

### First Task
To start off, we need to add a Navbar to the website. Luckily, this component has already been built. All you have to do is add it in the App.js file.

### Second Task
Open the file for the pizza component. It seems like the last developer made a few typos. Please edit the text so everything is spelled correctly. Also, add Jeff's name to the text as well.

### Third Task
Open the CSS file that is associated with the pizza component (there might be clues at the top of the file where to find it).
Edit the css so that the font is the correct size and centered properly.

The same must be done in the css file for the Menu component. Find the css file associated with the Menu component and edit the style so it looks like the mock up.

### Fourth Task
It looks like the menu items were all just copied over! Please edit the text for each of the components associated with the different slices. Make sure the title, price, and description are correct.
Also, make sure the correct image is being imported at the top of the file.

### Fifth Task
Where is the Hawaiian slice? Please add it to the menu as well.

>Hint: Don't forget that each component must be imported at the start of the file.

## Final Task
It looks like our yoga instructor web developer completely forgot write the HTML for BBQ Chicken component. Please complete the component and then put it onto the menu.

## Extension
Can you create a whole new component on your own? Jeff would like a footer for the website that has the address and phone number for his pizza shop. Please create a footer component and add it to the website. The store address is 555 Time Square, NY NY 10000 and the phone number is (212) 555 5555
